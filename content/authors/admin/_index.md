I'm a recent graduate of [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) where I studied statistics with minors in geography and creative writing. Right now, I work at the [Metropolitan Council](https://www.metrocouncil.org) as an Associate Data Scientist. My work involves using location-based services to estimate park and trail visitation across the state. Previously, I interned at [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/home) where I fit hierarchical spatial Bayesian models of Twin Cities bus ridership. 

Outside of work, I love applying data science skills to new projects, like the [National Gallery of Art's](https://www.nga.gov/) first [datathon](https://www.nga.gov/audio-video/audio/datathon.html). My team explored gender diversity in the Gallery's collection and presented to Gallery curators and staff. When I'm not thinking about statistics, I love to write fiction, read, and get to know Minnesota's parks and trails better!
