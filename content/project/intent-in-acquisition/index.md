This is the app I created in collaboration with the National Gallery of Art. I would consider this app in the "prototype" stage -- my goal was to illustrate the types of questions that can be answered with the data the Gallery already collects. Check out the app [here](https://raven-mcknight.shinyapps.io/intent-in-acquisition/), or hear me talk more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewm4cL3vn6k&).
