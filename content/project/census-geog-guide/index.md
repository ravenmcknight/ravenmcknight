Our final project in my 2D Design class was called "Teach Me" -- we were meant to design something educational. My mind went straight to census geography! I designed this guide to be printed as a zine, but you can view a pdf of the pages [here.](https://www.ravenmcknight.com/files/census-geog-guide.pdf)

I covered five of the most common geographies, and focused on the county I live in right now. I also highlighted my favorite coffee shop to give a sense of scale. I even used the typeface I designed earlier in the semester! This was a super fun project to end the semester with :-)
