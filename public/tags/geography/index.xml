      <title>Meandering Minneapolis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2020, I got to take a class called Cultural Atlas Production at Macalester. Inspired by cartographers like Rebecca Solnit, and Macalester&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://issuu.com/maccarto/docs/curiouscity&#34;&gt;2019 cultural atlas of Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt;, the class created a cultural atlas of Minneapolis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My spread focused on The Amazon Bookstore Cooperative, the oldest lesbian bookstore in the country. It existed in Minneapolis from the early 1970s until it closed in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many things, this project was affected by COVID-19 when lockdown began. Despite those challenges, I&amp;rsquo;m so impressed with everything my classmates created. You can see the whole cultural atlas and read more about the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macalester.edu/news/2020/08/meandering-minneapolis/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saint Paul 3K</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This StoryMap was created in collaboration with my Urban GIS class at Macalester. The class consists of a semester-long project supporting a community partner &amp;ndash; in our case, Saint Paul City Councilmember Rebecca Noeker and the Saint Paul 3K Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0350ab8ab7824256a4bfd3eef012eb74&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Saint Paul 3K is to provide affordable, accessible childcare to all 3- and 4-year olds in Saint Paul. This is the second time Urban GIS has partnered with Councilmember Noeker. Our work focused on &lt;strong&gt;primary data collection&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;identifying barriers to care&lt;/strong&gt; across Saint Paul. Check out the full StoryMap &lt;a href=&#34;https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0350ab8ab7824256a4bfd3eef012eb74&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wannabe Geographer&#39;s Guide to Census Geography</title>
      <link>https://ravenmcknight.com/project/census-geog-guide/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our final project in my 2D Design class was called &amp;ldquo;Teach Me&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; we were meant to design something educational. My mind went straight to census geography! I designed this guide to be printed as a zine, but you can view a pdf of the pages &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ravenmcknight.com/files/census-geog-guide.pdf&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ravenmcknight.com/files/census-geog-guide.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I covered five of the most common geographies, and focused on the county I live in right now. I also highlighted my favorite coffee shop to give a sense of scale. I even used the typeface I designed earlier in the semester! This was a super fun project to end the semester with :-)&lt;/p&gt;
